mTIM: margin-based transcript mapper 
====================================

TRAIN'n'PREP : for an working example see mTIM_galaxy_test.m

GALAXY
------

The current implementation of mTIM uses a
full annotation. In short, mTIM can be divided into 4 parts:

A) data preparation:
   - divides the genome into train/vald and test chunks
     using information from the annotation file
   - the annotation/reads and splice-sites are read 
     in and the train/vald and test chunks are filled with the features
   - this process can take long time 
   - 3 xval

B) training:
   - n chunks from all training chunks are used for training (n is preset)
   
C) prediction:
   - uses a trained model to predict on the test chunks
   
D) evaluation:
   - takes the predicted genes from mtim and
     compares them against the annotation delivering
     intron/transcript and gene f-scores (and sens/prec)
   


Problems:
---------
- it is necessary in the current implementation that the annotation covers the whole genome 
- in prediction it should be possible to add user defined chunks
